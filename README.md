# Good Food
## A food calorie tracker

Good food is a food calorie tracker that allows users to search for a particular meal, get a list of meals related to the search, choose the number of servings the user wants then calculates the total calories and adds the meal to the list. You can add different meals with different amount of servings and the grand total calories will be calculated automatically for all meals in the list. Users are also able to delete meals from the list.
